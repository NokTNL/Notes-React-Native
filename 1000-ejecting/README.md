- The Expo Go app is a RUNTIME that interprets the Javascript you wrote and bundle them

- You have two choices:

1. Use the Expo Bare workflow (have access to tools provided by Expo, but do not use the Expo Go runtime)
2. Use React Native CLI (not using Expo at all)

# Setup for the Bare workflow

- https://docs.expo.dev/bare/hello-world/
- `npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum`
